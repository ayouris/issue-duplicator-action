## Usage

`.github/workflows/issue-duplicator.yml`:

```yml
name: Issue Duplicator

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: mashabow/issue-duplicator-action@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_PROJECT_PAT }}
```

### Input

- `github-token` **(required)** is a [personal access
  token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with `repo` and `project` scopes.

## Development

### Code in Main

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy. This won't work with versions older than 9, for instance.

Install the dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution

```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:

```bash
$ npm test

 PASS  ./index.test.js
  ✓ throws invalid number (3ms)
  ✓ wait 500 ms (504ms)
  ✓ test runs (95ms)

...
```

### Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder.

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:

```bash
$ npm run package
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
$ git push origin releases/v1
```

Note: We recommend using the `--license` option for ncc, which will create a license file for all of the production node modules used in your project.

Your action is now published! :rocket:
